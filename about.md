## üè¢ Work experience

### [Software Mansion](https://www.swmansion.com) - 3 years
Software Mansion is a well-regarded, publicly listed software house based in Cracow, Poland. It's especially known for it's vast contribution and presence in the [React Native community](https://swmansion.com/react-native). <br>
I worked there as a software engineer, working mostly with:
- React Native (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Swift
- Kotlin
- Python
- C++

And for the following clients:
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) I worked with Amazon's US engineering branch, sadly I cannot share details about my work there.
- [Starkware](https://www.starkware.co) - Israeli blockchain scaling startup. I worked on building developer tools around Starknet blockchain. The ones I contributed to the most are:
  - [starknet.swift](https://github.com/software-mansion/starknet.swift) Starknet SDK for Swift language
  - [starknet-jvm](https://github.com/software-mansion/starknet-jvm) Starknet SDK for JVM languages, written in Kotlin
  - [starknet-foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry) Toolkit for developing and testing Starknet smart contracts, written in Rust.
- [Mos.com](https://www.mos.com) - a SF-based neobank for students, that helps them finance their studies. We built the app, maintained it and made it to the third place in the [US AppStore charts](https://x.com/mosdotcom/status/1462595591544848390)!


### [Visla.co](visla.co) - 1 year
During my first software engineering job I worked as a React Native engineer, and developed a mobile application for a time management SaaS.
